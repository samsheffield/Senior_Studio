# Professional Development Visit

## Today

### Work Session & Prototype 3 Check-ins
Get some work done today! After lunch, we'll check in with everyone and take a look at your progress so far. We may have class visitors from a school in Hamburg, Germany who are in seeing what you are up to. Please have something to show!

### Prototype 3 Scheduling
Make sure you are carefully budgeting your time this cycle. We have a holiday at the end of next week which will affect your normal Friday studio session, and we have no time remaining in the semester for you to miss this prototype's final deadline on 11/29. This is the week after Thanksgiving, so please manage your time so that you are not scheduling work when you could be taking a break. 

**We will be meeting on Tuesday next week.** It will be a work session with quick check-ins towards the end of the day. Informal playtesting will be managed by request. Let me know in the morning next week if you want to test. 

### This Wednesday: Career Development Networking Event: Practice & Pie
Representatives from Firaxis, Big Huge Games, and Zenimax will all be participating in this fun, low-key networking event, and, even though signups are currently full, if you register for the waitlist as a GMD student, you will be let in to the event. 

Date: Wednesday, Nov 16, 2:30 - 4:30 pm
Location: BBOX (in-person)
Register: Visit micanetwork.com > student login > events > Practice & Pie

About the event: 
_It’s casual! It’s fun! It’s networking with pie! Meet local internship hosts and MICA alumni. Practice your conversational skills/professionally talking about yourself and your work for future interviews and portfolio reviews. Make connections with potential internship hosts and/or industry professionals. Ask alumni insider industry questions you want to know more about._
