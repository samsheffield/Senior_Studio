# W E L C O M E &nbsp; B A C K ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Online! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class.
- Reconnect with projects

## This semester...
These are our priorities this semester:
- Develop, playtest, and release your Senior Project games
- Identify and research game design career paths that line up with your skillsets and interests
- Prepare professional materials to support post-MICA plans

## Senior Project Important Deadlines
- __April 11th: Final builds produced and Google Drive link shared via MGL Discord.__ Final in-class playtest as a group
- April 25th: Presskit & 30-60 second promo trailer due. Builds are uploaded to itch.io
- May 2nd: Final presentations for guest panelists

## Pre-production & planning mode
We'll spend the first few weeks of the semester prototyping, planning, and researching. The specific shape of this will depend somewhat on the needs of your project.

At the end of this cycle, you should be able to:
1. Describe what it is you are making
2. Communicate your project goals (design goals + player experience goals).
3. Identify key areas, biggest risks, and unknowns about your project.
3. Use your prototypes as the basis for your game's development.
4. Identify a realistic scope for your work relative to your team size/composition.
5. Sketch out a development schedule.


### Planning & Making
_"A goal without a plan is just a wish"_ - Antoine de Saint-Exupery

No amount of planning that we can do will guarantee that we will make interesting, fun, challenging, meaningful things. We're also faced with the conundrum of trying to plan for things we don't know yet, even as fundamental as _what is this game, anyways??_

Planning can help us understand what we're making, what are its goals, who it is for, and how it's played. It can assist us in making critical decisions regarding the scope and allocation of time/energy/resources towards making it, which is particularly relevant in at this moment where we have limited time/energy/resources. (Deadlines.)

_When is planning done? When can I start making the game?_ Once you know a little about what you want to make, start prototyping. There's no reason to wait for planning to to finished. Truth is, your planning will need to be revised and revisited throughout your game's development.

Designing games is a discovery-based practice, in which we follow our instincts and tastes as designers. There are going to be times when things don't work and we have to move on, or change plans, and times when we have to learn some new thing that we just don't know. _This is normal!_


## Masterpiece Syndrome
There is a common issue which pops up around this time for many students regarding their thesis work, in which students put unfair pressure on the role of this work in their lives.

_"It should be perfect, it should be ambitious, it should be better than anything you've ever made, it should demonstrate everything I know and have learned as a student!"_

This kind of thinking can be paralyzing, particularly at the beginning of the semester (_"I don't want to do this wrong"_) and the end (_"This needs to be perfect."_). It can result in anxiety, confusion, and resentment. A lot of people stop making things because they never learn how to manage this.

As a way of countering this kind of non-productive thinking:
1. Focus on making.
2. Don't overthink things.
3. Embrace failures.

Also, understand that this is not unique to you as students. As creative people, you'll experience this in different shades throughout your life. There is a great snippet from Ira glass on something he refers to as ["the gap""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91FQKciKfHI) which characterizes  you are curently in.

## Brainstorming activity
We're going to spend a little time together reconnecting with project ideas. You can do this actvity independently, or with your project partner (if you have one).

### 20 minutes:
Spend twenty minutes writing or sketching down _any idea_ that you have related to your game. This is building off of your end-of-semester work from the fall. Every possibility you can think of. Don't spend time expanding too deeply on single ideas, just jot them down. The goal is for quantity over quality. In artistic practice terms, we might call this _automatic writing_ approach.

### 10 minutes:
Go through what you've compiled and create a prioritized list of the things which feel most important to you. This is an opportunity to look for patterns, combine ideas, identify core concepts, etc. 

### Follow-up:
As a group:
- Describe what it is you think you're going to be making. Remind us and inform us of any changes in thinking from the end of last semester.
- Share some of the things you prioritized.

# Homework

## Set up your workspace for this semester's work.

- Create an online folder to share classwork this semester.
- Create an online document which serves as the development log for your game.
- Migrate any pertinent notes from last semester's prototyping into your development folder. _Do not include the full set if it includes prototypes unrelated to what your working on now._
- Please add dates for each entry into your development log.
- __Share the link with me by the start of next class__ (after you complete this week's development log entry).

## Describe your game:
In your game development log:
- Describe your game as you currently know it. 
- What is a central concept of the game?* 
- What is a key player experience goal for your game?*
- What are your personal design goals for the game?
- Prototyping notes (see below)
- Research nots (see below)

_* You can list more than one, but prioritize the items in the list._

## Prototype
- Identify (at least) one aspect of your game which is critical to your game and make a small prototype which tests its viability. 
- Put a link to the prototype in your dev log entry for this week and describe:
    - Why you made this prototype.
    - What additional prototypes would benefit you at this stage of development.
- Upload a build (Mac, PC, or WebGL) to your folder.
- __Show it to us next week in class.__

## Research
- Identify (at least) one aspect of your game which you want to know more about and conduct some research on it.
- Document your research and what you learned.
- __Describe or show this to us next week in class.__

# Coming soon

## Global Game Jam!
Global Game Jam is coming up soon (Feb 3rd-5th). This is a great opportunity to warm up, make another thing to add to your portfolio, work with new people/work with friends/work by yourself, and have fun! Sign up [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites/mica-game-lab).
