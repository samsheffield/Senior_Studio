## Senior Studio (GMD 498.01)

### About
This is the archive for Game Design Senior Studio, taught in the Game Design program at the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2020/21 by Sam Sheffield (ssheffield@mica.edu). It is primarily intended for student use, but if what you find seems helpful to you, enjoy! Maybe drop me a line and say Hi.

### Course Description
Students will spend the semester working in teams to create a game prototype that they
will then refine and polish during the Spring semester. The goal of this course is for students
to demonstrate their ability to research, design, and test a game which conveys their own
personal voice as well as an understanding of the field of game design.

#### This Semester...
The focus will be on prototyping a small complete game or vertical slice of a larger game. You
will be spending this semester working in small, self-selected teams to develop a fully playable
prototype, which will be uploaded to itch.io and present at the end of the semester. Some
professional development will come at the end of the semester when we begin discussing how
to document, present, and promote your work online.

#### Next Semester...
The focus will be on refining and promoting your playable prototype into a complete
demo and professional development. For digital games, a playable demo with social media
promotion and full presskit will be the final deliverables. For non-digital games, a fabricated
deliverable with social media promotion and full presskit, plus print & play (or other
appropriate online deliverable) will be the final deliverables.

### Course Goals
- Learn to research, design, and build refined games and playful projects
- Learn to develop project plans and game design documents.
- Communicate & present game designs from concept to finished form.

### Student Learning Outcomes
- Students will understand how to build, test, and evaluate games using an iterative design
approach.
- Students will learn how to manage design and production in a team based environment.
- Students will analyze games as complex interactive systems.
- Students will gain skills in communicating and presenting ideas from concept to finished
form.

### Software Versions
