# Prototype 2 Documentation
Class notes for 10/31/23

## Review Post-development Documentation
Let's check out your documentation. __Please post your URL to the class Discord.__

As a reminder, this documentation should include:
1. A brief description of the prototype
    - What is it and how does it work.
2. One or two goals for the prototype
    - This needs to be related to the questions you had as a designer while making the prototype, and what you learned from it through development and playtesting
3. One role you played in developing the prototype (such as game designer, level designer, narrative designer, technical artist, puzzle designer, etc.)
    - Give details regarding the process of creating the prototype from the perspective of one role you played in its development
4. Embedded videos or gifs and compelling images which support your writing.
    - This media is intended to help communicate what you're discussing in 1-3.

## Proof-of-concept Prototype

### Overview
For the remainder of the semester, you will be responsible for developing a proof-of-concept prototype that will lay the groundwork for the game you will complete as your Senior Project in the Spring semester.

### Collaboration
The Senior Project must be completed in collaboration with your peers. No one works independently.

You are welcome to collaborate with students outside of this class, but 
you are __strongly encouraged__ to make sure that your team is composed of at least two Game Design students who are currently enrolled in this class. This is to ensure that your team has enough design and development skills to see it through to completion in the spring. More below.

#### Exceptions to collaboration
1. You are a double major responsible for two thesis projects. 
2. You are graduating this semester.

#### Outside collaborators
If you decide to collaborate with students outside of the Senior Studio, they will be expected to adhere to our development schedule for the proof-of-concept and Senior Project. I would recommend that they coordinate an Independent Study to ensure that your team has time each week dedicated to staying on schedule. Your partner(s) are also encouraged to participate in the end-of-semester presentations.


#### This semester

The proof-of-concept development schedule looks like this
- Week of 10/31: Form teams and begin prototyping
- Week of 11/07: Check-in and class visit from Heather Slania to discuss research
- Week of 11/14: First playable prototype due for playtesting
- Week of 11/21: Second playable prototype due
- Week of 11/28: Complete prototype and begin presentation
- Week of 12/05: Final playtesting and presentation practice
- 12/12: Final presentations

#### Next semester

Next semester's development schedule will look roughly like this:
- Weeks 1-3: Prototyping, pre-production, product scoping, and budgeting
- Weeks 4-12: Core development and lots of playtesting
- Weeks 13-15: Publishing, Presentations

### Deliverables
- Completed prototype (20% of final grade)
- End of semester presentation (10% of final grade)


## Homework

### Begin proof-of-concept prototype
You are expected to make some progress on Friday, as well as before or after Friday. These are your top priorities:

1. Find a team.
2. Pick a direction.
3. Start prototyping.

#### Development logs
Each team member will need to create a development log to track individual progress.

This will be the first entry in your development log:
- Date.
- Describe the prototype you want to make, its goals, and its scope.
- Prototyping goals for this week's work session.
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions you asked (refer to the list above for ideas), and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your prototyping.
- A link to documentation below.

#### Documentation
- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated development log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***

### Set up online workspace
- Set up a Google Drive folder to share your work. __Send me the link.__
- Optional: Set up a project management workspace using [Trello](https://trello.com/). __Invite me to join your team.__
