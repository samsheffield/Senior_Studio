# G O O D &nbsp; M O R N I N G ! !
A short group meeting today...
- Any new questions?
- Share project plans as a group
- Vist from Matteo Uguzzoni @ MICA Game Lab to discuss tutorship service he's providing this semester.
- Work session & breakout groups.

__Group Check-In__
- Your project's working title
- Briefly describe your game
- What are your goals for this semester? (Are you creating a small game, or a vertical slice? Is it a demo?) For next semester? (Are you adding more content? Refining what you have? Connecting with an artist to help with audiovisual assets?)

__Work session and team check-ins...__
- [Sign up for a meeting here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9Ticgjto2_bmNmXr8spZXCqoJ6UFXF6G1iPSzRIiHE/edit?usp=sharing)
- I want to see your team's progress on your Proof of Concept Prototype. Be prepared to share screens.
- Maximum of 30 minutes per team.
- Last meeting at 2:30 PM EST.
- You don't need to stay active in Zoom until our time to meet, just rejoin the class meeting about 5-10 minutes before your selected time slot.

__Next Monday... Milestone 1 (Proof-of-Concept Prototype). Due 09/28__
- This is an exploration of core mechanics and themes. Work on implementing game feeling and creating desired player experience. Absolutely no focus on audiovisual assets.
- Uploaded prototype materials (Digital game: Win/Mac builds) that a member of your team will demonstrate for the class on 09/28 (live, or prerecorded). Not a playtest, just a demonstration and discussion.
- Reach out to me if you need me to share your materials while you talk about where things are and where you are going.
