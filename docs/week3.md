# Prototype Playtesting
Class notes for 09/12/23

## Today
### Exploratory Prototype playtesting
Today, we'll meet as a group to playtest your first prototype.
1. Only provide enough information to run your playtest.
2. Shhh. __Observational only.__ Use a notebook and take notes on what you see.
3. You are allowed to ask questions afterwards, but only if they are based on things you observed.


### Code in the Schools site visit @ 1:30
After lunch, we're going to make a visit to Code in the Schools to learn about their organization and how you might become involved.

Code in the Schools is located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/mcSy3kF9tVB1PyTG7). We can meet there, walk, or take the [MICA Circulator shuttle](https://www.mica.edu/offices-divisions/office-of-transportation-services/mica-circulator/). Let me know what you intend to do and stay in touch via the class Discord.


#### Schedule
__TODAY: In-progress playtesting__
- Time to test your assumptions
- No explaining to players, just observing and note taking
- Feedback (but only if you request it and ask for something specific)

__09/19: Final playtesting and discussion__
- Prototype is completed
- Playtesting session (Feel free to invite people from outside of class)
- No questions for players, just observing and note taking
- Tell us what you were trying to accomplish and how it went
- Feedback and discussion as a group

__09/26: Documentation due__
- One page website highlighting an aspect of the prototype's development and details highlighting your role(s) in its development
- We will discuss strategies for this on 09/19, but for now focus on doing the work and documenting your steps along the way in your weekly development log entries.


## Homework

### Prepare for final playtesting next week
__Next week's playtesting is also 100% observational.__ Explain only what is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, no talking until we have some follow-up as a group.

If you want to follow up afterwards based on something you observed, resist explaining and instead focus on asking questions that relate to the experience your playtesters just had.

Therefore, it's important that you already have some ideas about what assumptions you are putting to test in this last playtest. Think about what your overall goals are for the prototype this week. Are you close?

__Bring a notepad and writing utensil to class.__ (Don't rely on your phone or laptop.) You will be asked to reflect on the playtest in next week's development log.

### Complete development on Exploratory Prototype 1
You are expected to make some progress on Friday, as well as before or after Friday. 

### Friday's studio work session
We need something fully playable (relative to your own goals) in class next week. Digital games can be run as projects on your own computer (no builds necessary). Non-video games require all the things needed to play them to be complete upon arrival. 

Thank you in advance for arriving early if your prototype requires any time-consuming setup.


#### Development log
For your development log:
- Date.
- Prototyping goals for this week's work session.
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions you asked (refer to the list above for ideas), and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your prototyping.
- __Goals for final playtesting next week (What do you intend to observe? What questions are you looking to answer with this playtest?)__
- A link to documentation below.

#### Documentation
- Build (or project if you have enough Drive space) for digital games. _For non-video games please submit equivalent proof of work which provides a snapshot of your work._
- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated development log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***


# Upcoming Events

## GMD Student Show (09/17-09/25)
I want to show the games from A3D last semester. We can produce whatever kinds of supporting materials you might want to put on the walls. 

Also looking for assistance setting it all up between 09/13-09/16.

Send me Mac builds of your A3D projects please:
- Make sure they can be reset (and let me know how!)
