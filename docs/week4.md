## Informal Playtesting
First half of today's class: informal playtesting of your WIP prototypes. For digital games: you do not need to provide a build unless you want (email to me to share with class).

Second half: Work session.

## Homework

### Friday's studio work session: Complete work on prototype 1
Begin wrapping up development of your prototype. You will need to complete anything you don't finish Friday for class next week. The goal is to have a fully playable prototype for playtesting and discussing.

* Update: I overlooked the invitation for student involvement for Professional Development, so there is no penalty this week for late/missing dev logs. *

#### Development Log

This will be the fourth entry in your development log:
- Date.
- Prototyping goals for this week's work session.
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions for yourself, and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your prototyping.
- Link to documentation below.

#### Documentation
- Build (or project if you have enough Drive space) for digital games

AND/OR...

- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated dev log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***

***Yes, I have the link to your folders already. This is to confirm the work is complete and submitted for the day.***
