# HI
We're back! In person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Playtest and discuss your prototypes

## Today

# Prototype Milestone 1 Playtesting
A goal of this month's prototyping was to see how the pieces fit together in a broader sense than with your proof of concept. Is it achieving your player experience goals? Is it fun/interesting/compelling? How can we help make it better?

Here are the *minimum* expectations for today...
- A prototype which is a small playable section of your game. This does not need to be your entire game/vertical slice (but it might be!)
- Early, or in-progress, audiovisual assets. 
- The game can certainly be in a buggy state, but it needs to be playable so you will need to direct us around issues, problems, incomplete, non-functional stuff.

## Playtesting

Vanessa, Puhan & Zining:
- Post a link on the class Discord to your playable Win/Mac builds and playesting feedback form (if not printed)
- Make sure to include README.txt file with information on the build
  - Instructions
  - Controls
  - Known bugs and other non-functioning things

Ariana & Parker: 
- Set up your game on TT Simulator out in the main lab
- Distribute printed copies of rules and information on known issues
- Share playtesting feedback form on class Discord (if not printed)

## Feedback Form

Please provide a playtesting form that can be used to collect specific feedback on your prototype. 
- Google Doc or printed copies
- Focus on a few high quality, specific questions instead of many broad, vague ones (*Is it fun?*)

# Wednesday...
- Once again, Wednesday is a work session. 
- Continuing developing your prototype based on feedback you recieved today. Let's have something that can be demonstrated next week.
- Reminder: This work session is not optional. __You will have a progress update due by the end of the day__.

# In Two Weeks
## Prototype Milestone 2 (November 8th)
__The next required playtest is in two weeks.__

Your prototype should have its full gameplay loop at this point. It should make sense to us as players, communicating what we do, why, and to what end. This prototype includes in- progress audio or visual assets and basic in-game instructions. A little buggy is okay here as long as it mostly works as expected.

## Guest Speaker: Winnie Song (November 10th)
We're excited to have Winnie Song (BADBLOOD, former Square Enix) join us on Wednesday, Nov. 10th at 4:30pm to talk about [her work](https://wsong.me). She'll be giving the talk on twitch.tv/micagamelab. Please mark your calendars.
