## Media for Senior Studio game packaging (Complete by end of the semester)
We will pay to fabricate USB promo boxes for your completed Senior Studio game. [Here is the link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T84oBKlAGsAJs3zXgnF0BomGon-8hPxs?usp=sharing) to a template provided by Red Paper Plane.

- You can approach this in whatever way makes sense for your game
- Use images that are large or high DPI (300dpi if possible)
- Include screengrabs and a brief, compelling description of your game for the back cover.

Have a non-digital game? We can also discuss purchasing components, boxes, or other forms of fabrication!

_You can pick these up in-person over the summer or we can mail them to you!_

## Work due next Friday!
Stay healthy! Have a plan! Reach out for help!
