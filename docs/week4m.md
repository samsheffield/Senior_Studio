## Today

__Proof of Concept (Due next week)__

A proof of concept is a type of early prototype which demonstrates the viability of a project. The goal is to verify that the idea has functional or practical potential, and therefore worthy of continued development. For example, in game development, there might be several POCs as part of a game's preproduction phase which are geared towards testing gameplay loops and core mechanics to see if they are *as fun (or interesting) as imagined*.

*Have you seen [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IJMXW0_dcU)?*

Your goal this week will be to create a small exploration of what your game fundamentally is about. The focus should be on your core mechanics, systems, and ideas; and able to demonstrate what excites you about your game. Absolutely no focus on audiovisual assets. Use thoughtful placeholders for art.
