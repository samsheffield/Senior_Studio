# HI
We're back! In person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Check in briefly and work


## Today
# Work Session

Today is a work session. We'll briefly check in, bu tthe majority of the class is dedicated to getting work done.

# Prototype Milestone 2 (Next Monday)
__The next required playtest is Monday.__

Your prototype should have its full gameplay loop at this point. It should make sense to us as players, communicating what we do, why, and to what end. This prototype includes in- progress audio or visual assets and basic in-game instructions or update rulesets. A little buggy is okay here as long as it mostly works as expected.

## Deliverable

Digital games:
- An uploaded playable prototype (Tested Win/Mac builds)
- A README.txt file with information on the build (known bugs, non-functioning things, and instructions if not included in-game already)
- Include mapped buttons/keys which quit and restart the game.

Tabletop game: 
- Set up on Tabletop Simulator and ready to play on the main lab "lounge" PC
- 4 printed copies of the rules and information on known issues

# Wednesday...
- Once again, Wednesday is a work session. 
- __I'll also have an updated research prompt for you as part of your classwork.__
- Continue developing your prototype to meet Milestone 2
