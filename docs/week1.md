# Class Introduction

# W E L C O M E &nbsp; B A C K ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...

## Today
### Discuss the class
So excited to welcome you all back in-person!
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class ([Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16n9ynIaXhGAcryLIEwBfpeYK2IpDd3oDKhHminUAnsU/edit?usp=sharing), Course adjustments & reasoning, Spring vs. Fall semesters, expectations and responsibilities)
- Any other concerns or questions? (This class, Senior year, ...uhh, Everything?!)

### Exploratory Prototype (Due 09/19)
This week you will begin developing a small exploratory, experimental, or open-ended prototype which will be due 3 weeks from now. This prototype can be related to an idea you may be interested in pursuing for your thesis project or independent of that. You can always revisit it when forming teams later in the semester (for those not doing dual thesis projects). 

You can work individually or in teams on this prototype.

Reminder: the next small prototype can't be a direct continuation of this one. Focus on getting what you need out of this one without additional development. If you're working with a larger concept for a game, ask different questions with the next prototype.

#### Schedule
09/05: Check-in and sharing 
- Show us what are you working on 
- Tell us what questions you've been using the prototype to answer
- Tell us where you think it's headed

09/12: In-progress playtesting
- Time to test your assumptions
- No questions for players, just observing and note taking
- Feedback (but only if you request it and ask for something specific)

09/19: Final playtesting and discussion
- Prototype is completed
- Playtesting session (Feel free to invite people from outside of class)
- No questions for players, just observing and note taking
- Tell us what you were trying to accomplish and how it went
- Feedback and discussion as a group

09/26: Documentation due
- One page website highlighting an aspect of the prototype's development and details highlighting your role(s) in its development
- We will discuss strategies for this on 09/12, but for now focus on doing the work and documenting your steps along the way in your weekly development log entries.

### Small reminders about prototyping

The goal of prototyping is not to end up with a finished game, it's to answer questions that the designers have.

_What kind of questions?*_
- What player activity am I prototyping here?
- What game verbs** am I investigating?
- What kind of experience does this player activity*** produce?
- What tone or mood does the player activity have?
- What interesting gameplay and story things can I do with this player activity right now?
- How much could I do with this player activity if I had the time to devise different situations and scenarios in which to use it?
- **What question am I trying to answer with this prototype?**

*This list is from the uber-helpful A Playful Production Process by Richard LeMarchand

** Game verbs: the things a player does in a game. (Examples: Walk, run, jump, etc.)

*** Player activities are the ways a player uses the verbs (Example: Walking around looking for a door with WASD)


## Homework

### Before you leave: Say hi in the class Discord channel
I need to assign you each a role before I make the channel private. Please say hello in the #senior-studio-f23 channel before you leave today.

### Create your working space
- Set up your self-hosted Google Drive folder where you will share work.
- Google Document which will serve as your development log for classwork
- ***Share a link with me via email.***

### Begin working on Exploratory Prototype 1
You are expected to make some progress on Friday, as well as before or after Friday. 

### Friday's studio work session
This will be the first entry in your development log:
- Date.
- Describe the prototype you want to make, its goals, and its scope.
- Prototyping goals for this week's work session.
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions you asked (refer to the list above for ideas), and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your prototyping.
- A link to documentation below.

#### Documentation
- Build (or project if you have enough Drive space) for digital games
- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated development log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***


# Upcoming Events

## This Friday: Game Night at the MICA Game Lab! 6-9 PM
Let's kick off the new school year with a game night hosted by the MICA Game Lab! Join us for a night of good games,good  snacks, and good times. Check out our lab's impressive collection of tabletop and multiplayer video games, or bring your own favorites to play with new and old friends. 

All students are welcome, so invite your friends!

## Next Monday (09/04) 12-6:30 pm: Labor Day Game Jam.

MICA Start is hosting a small game jam for all students in the Game Lab (D220) on Labor Day. Sounds like a great opportunity to meet some new people, learn about MICA Start, and shake off some of that summertime rust from your Unity skills. 

Or maybe make a card game? Or a game about whispering outside? How about an "actually fun" ice breaker that we can use in classes? No experience needed. 

Help spread the word!

## GMD Student Show (09/17-09/25)
I want to show the games from A3D last semester. We can produce whatever kinds of supporting materials you might want to put on the walls. 

Also looking for assistance setting it all up between 09/13-09/16.
