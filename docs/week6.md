# Prototype Check-ins
Class notes for 10/03/23

## Today
### Exploratory Prototype (Due 10/24)
Today, we'll meet as a group to check-in on your progress on the second prototype.
- Show us what are you working on now. (Demonstrate where things currently are. When describing things, be as specific as possible) 
- What are some of your goals for this prototype? (What questions does the prototype to answer for you at this point? And when it's finished?)
- Tell us where you think it's headed


### Work session
- Work continues!
- I will meet with each of you if there is specific information I would like to follow up on. Grab me if you need to discuss something.


## Homework

### Prepare for playtesting next week
__Next week's playtesting is 100% observational.__ Explain only what is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, no talking. 

If you want to follow up afterwards based on something you observed, resist explaining and instead focus on asking questions that relate to the experience your playtesters just had.

Therefore, it's important that you already have some ideas about what assumptions you are putting to test in this playtest. Think about it this week.

__Bring a notepad and writing utensil to class.__ (Don't rely on your phone or laptop.) You will be asked to reflect on the playtest in next week's development log.

### Continue working on Exploratory Prototype 2
You are expected to make some progress on Friday, as well as before or after Friday. 

### Friday's studio work session
We need something playable in the first half of class next week. Digital games can be run as projects on your own computer (no builds necessary). Non-video games require all the things needed to play them to be complete upon arrival. 

Thank you in advance for arriving early if your prototype requires any time-consuming setup.


#### Development log
For your development log:
- Date.
- Prototyping goals for this week's work session.
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions you asked (refer to the list above for ideas), and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your prototyping.
- __Goals for playtesting next week (What do you intend to observe? What questions are you looking to answer with this playtest?)__
- A link to documentation below.

#### Documentation
- Build (or project if you have enough Drive space) for digital games. _For non-video games please submit equivalent proof of work which provides a snapshot of your work._
- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated development log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***


# Upcoming Events

## This Saturday: IGDA District Arcade
I was able to secure a table at next Saturday's IGDA District Arcade event in Silver Springs to show off some student games. Let me know if you're interested in participating and have transportation to get there and back. More info [here](https://www.meetup.com/igda-dc/events/295326258/).

_I'll also be there showing an arcade prototype I've been working on!_

## STEM Festival Opening Event (Oct 12th)
We've also been invited to participate in the opening event for the MD STEM Festival on the evening of October 12th at Howard County Community College. 

They're looking for any interested students who want to demo their games at the event and they will pay for an Uber/Lyft if you don't have your own transportation. [link](https://marylandstemfestival.org/events/maryland-stem-festival-2023-opening-ceremony).
