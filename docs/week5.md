# Prototype 1 Documentation
Class notes for 09/26/23

## Review Post-development Documentation
Let's check out your documentation. __please post your URL to the class Discord.__

As a reminder, this documentation should include:
1. A brief description of the prototype
    - What is it and how does it work.
2. One or two goals for the prototype
    - This needs to be related to the questions you had as a designer while making the prototype, and what you learned from it through development and playtesting
3. One role you played in developing the prototype (such as game designer, level designer, narrative designer, technical artist, puzzle designer, etc.)
    - Give details regarding the process of creating the prototype from the perspective of one role you played in its development
4. Embedded videos or gifs and compelling images which support your writing.
    - This media is intended to help communicate what you're discussing in 1-3.

## Exploratory Prototype 2 (Due 10/24)
This week you will begin developing another small exploratory, experimental, or open-ended prototype which will be due 3 weeks from now. This prototype can be related to an idea you may be interested in pursuing for your thesis project or independent of that. You can always revisit it when forming teams later in the semester (for those not doing dual thesis projects). 

You can work individually or in teams on this prototype.

Reminder: the next small prototype can't be a direct continuation of the first one. Focus on getting what you need out of this one without additional development. If you're working with a larger concept for a game, ask different questions with this prototype.

### Schedule
10/03: Check-in and sharing 
- Show us what are you working on 
- Tell us what questions you've been using the prototype to answer
- Tell us where you think it's headed

10/10: In-progress playtesting
- Time to test your assumptions
- No questions for players, just observing and note taking
- Feedback (but only if you request it and ask for something specific)

10/24: Final playtesting and discussion
- Prototype is completed
- Playtesting session (Feel free to invite people from outside of class)
- No questions for players, just observing and note taking
- Tell us what you were trying to accomplish and how it went
- Feedback and discussion as a group

10/31: Documentation due
- One page website highlighting an aspect of the prototype's development and details highlighting your role(s) in its development

# Homework

## Begin working on Exploratory Prototype 2
You are expected to make some progress on Friday, as well as before or after Friday. 

### Create a new development log specific to this prototype 
You can add this to your pre-existing online workspace. Keep things organized.

### Friday's studio work session
This will be the first entry in this prototype's development log:
- Date.
- Describe the prototype you want to make, its goals, and its scope.
- Prototyping goals for this week's work session.
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions you asked (refer to the list above for ideas), and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your prototyping.
- A link to documentation below.

### Documentation
- Build (or project if you have enough Drive space) for digital games
- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated development log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***
