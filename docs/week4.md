# Prototype 1 Final Playtesting
Class notes for 09/19/23

## Today
### Exploratory Prototype final playtesting
Today, we'll meet as a group to run one more playtest on your first prototype.
1. Only provide enough information to run your playtest.
2. Shhh. __Observational only.__ Use a notebook and take notes on what you see.
3. Afterwards we'll follow-up as a group to hear your thoughts and give you any additional feedback we might have.

### Post-development Documentation
For this prototypes, you will be required to create a one-page website which documents your work and highlights your role in developing it. For the website, I recommend using a free website builder such as [Adobe Portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com/sites) unless web design is a skill set which you already have. 

This should include:
1. A brief description of the prototype
    - What is it and how does it work.
2. One or two goals for the prototype
    - This needs to be related to the questions you had as a designer while making the prototype, and what you learned from it through development and playtesting
3. One role you played in developing the prototype (such as game designer, level designer, narrative designer, technical artist, puzzle designer, etc.)
    - Give details regarding the process of creating the prototype from the perspective of one role you played in its development
4. Embedded videos or gifs and compelling images which support your writing.
    - This media is intended to help communicate what you're discussing in 1-3.

#### Example
Hereâ€™s [a good example](https://kierab.myportfolio.com/two-dots) of what you're aiming for by Kiera Boyle, a recent GMD grad who now works for Firaxis.
