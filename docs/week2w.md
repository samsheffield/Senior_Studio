- I plan to answer any questions you have regarding the Game Design Document, but your team will need to direct any other conversation based on your needs. 
- Maximum of 30 minutes per team.
- Last meeting at 1:30 PM EST.
- You don't need to stay active in Zoom until our time to meet, just rejoin the class meeting about 5-10 minutes before your selected time slot.

__Next Week...__
- Make sure that a completed Game Design Document is in your private team channel by the start of class (9AM EST) on Monday, 09/14.
- We will discuss your Design Documents in individual meetings on Monday and Wednesday and share plans as a group on the 21st.

- A sign up sheet will be posted in the Slack on Monday morning for individual meetings beginning Monday afternoon and concluding Wednesday.
- There is no group meeting next week. __Our next group meeting will be Monday, September 21st @ 9AM EST__.

__Begin working towards Milestone 1 (Proof-of-Concept Prototype). Due 09/28__
- This is an exploration of core mechanics and themes. Work on implementing game feeling and creating desired player experience. Absolutely no focus on audiovisual assets.
- Uploaded prototype materials (Digital game: Win/Mac builds) that a member of your team will demonstrate for the class on 09/28 (live, or prerecorded). Not a playtest, just a demonstration and discussion.
