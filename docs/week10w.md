# Prototype Milestone 2 (Next Monday)
__The next required playtest is Monday.__

Your prototype should have its full gameplay loop at this point. It should make sense to us as players, communicating what we do, why, and to what end. This prototype includes in- progress audio or visual assets and basic in-game instructions or update rulesets. A little buggy is okay here as long as it mostly works as expected.

## Deliverable

Digital games:
- An uploaded playable prototype (Tested Win/Mac builds)
- A README.txt file with information on the build (known bugs, non-functioning things, and instructions if not included in-game already)
- Include mapped buttons/keys which quit and restart the game.

Tabletop game: 
- Set up on Tabletop Simulator and ready to play on the main lab "lounge" PC
- 4 printed copies of the rules and information on known issues

## Deliverable

Digital games:
- A link posted in #milestone-2 for builds (Tested Win/Mac builds)
- A README.txt file with information on the build (known bugs, non-functioning things, and instructions if not included in-game already)
- Include mapped buttons/keys which quit and restart the game.

Tabletop game: 
- Set up on Tabletop Simulator and ready to play on the main lab "lounge" PC
- 4 printed copies of the rules and information on known issues

## Feedback

These prototypes will be played in class and discussed as a group. Please provide a brief playtesting form (printed or via a Google Drive link posted in #milestone-2) that can be used to collect *specific feedback* on your prototype. I'd recommend focusing on a few high quality, big impact questions rather than a bunch of mushy "is it fun?" questions.


## Due by the end of class
- No need to update me on progress, we'll see your work on Monday :)

## Next week
- Milestone 2 Review on Monday. Make sure you have your work ready to play *by the start of class*.
- Updated research due
