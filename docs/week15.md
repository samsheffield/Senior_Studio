# Wrapping things up
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Finish things up
- Check-in with everyone
- Discuss student reviews

## Senior Project Important Deadlines
- Thursday(April 27th): Itch.io page & promotional media are due by the end of the day.
- Next Tuesday (May 2nd): Final presentations & reviews 

## Make sure your game is ready to share
This work needs to be *portfolio ready* before uploading and sharing media on itch.io. Are you ready? Please review last week's guidance and speak with me if you have any doubts.

## Student Reviews
- Uploaded work reviewed by reviewers and peers. Online feedback provided. (Saturday-Monday)
- In-person presentations & feedback (Tuesday 10-3:30)


### Uploading your games for review
- __Please have everything uploaded by Midnight on Thursday evening__ and share the link with me via email to confirm.
I will create a Google Doc to collect online feedback and share the link with you via email.


## Presentation Content

Each team is responsible for creating a short presentation on their game __no longer than 10 minutes__ in length. Use Powerpoint, Keynote, or Google Slides to organize your talk.

### Each presentation should include...
- Title of your game
- Names of team members & their roles.
- A 2-3 sentence description which succinctly and excitedly describes your game.
    - What kind of game is it? (Genre(s), play style)
    - What is your game's theme & setting?
    - What is your game's hook? (What's one novel, fun, or interesting thing about it? What are you proud of?)
- Inspiration
    - 3 significant precedents for your game. This can be a mix of games and non-games media (animation, film, books, stories, music, etc.)
    - Give examples of what you learned from these or how you used them as precedents for your own work.
- Development Process Overview
    - Tell us about the development of your project. Where did it come from? How did it get to where it is? Show us pictures.
- What are the plans for your game's future development?

### Want to practice?
 _Practice beforehand._ Do not improvise or wing it. I'm happy to meet online this week of over the weekend if you want to practice your presentation. Email me a request and we'll schedule it. *I may not be available Monday evening to practice.*

## Beyond itch.io? Portfolio Development Tips for Game Designers
Itch.io is a great home for your digital work, but sometimes you need a little more room to talk about _you_. While it's important when searching for opportunities to have materials available, you don't need to overthink this:

### Keep it simple

One of the most daunting things about collecting your work online is sometimes the feeling that you need a super unique website. _You don't._ For most people, simple and straightforward is going to work best. This is in line with the guidance for resumes.


### You portfolio should tell people...
1. Who you are.
2. What you can do (by highlighting specific examples).
3. How people can connect with you.

### What to show

1. Show the best work you have that shows off what you can do. 
2. Prioritize completed work over unfinished things. 
3. It is _far better_ to have fewer, high quality examples of your best work than many examples of varying quality.
4. Variety is good.

### Give things space
You will often tailor your resume to the jobs you are applying to. Having a portfolio site where projects are organized on individual pages will make it significantly easier to highlight skills that are relevant to specific positions.

### Three things that do not matter...
1. Where you host your site (It's okay to use a sitebuilder like [squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), [wix](https://www.wix.com), [adobe portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com), [wordpress](https://wordpress.com))
2. The URL (people will find you through search engines, social networks, itch.io, linkedin, etc.). 
3. Unique/clever web design (Use a sitebuilder if you don't already have web design skills)

### Should you pay money for this?

- Paid hosting & dedicated URL signal a degree of professionalism, but they are not mandatory. 
- Paid webhosting specifically can sometimes remove branding/advertising which you might find confusing or don't want to be connected with.

### No one is looking for your website (most of the time!)
- People are looking for you when they find you elsewhere and want more information
- Social media and participation in other networks/communities is valuable (but you get to pick your communities and your engagement level!)
- Have things ready and don't wait for an opportunity to arrive to begin preparing materials
