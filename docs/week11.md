### Heather Slania class visit
Heather is the head of the Decker Library, our program's library liaison, and an avid gamer!

She will be visiting from 12-1:30 today to talk with each group about your project ideas and to give guidance on possible research directions.

__Let's make a schedule for lunch breaks.__


## Homework

### Proof-of-concept prototype: First playable prototype
You are expected to make some progress on Friday, as well as before or after Friday. This is your top priority:

-  __You need a playable prototype which demonstrates where you are heading and what's interesting/fun/novel about the idea.__ That means it should contain enough gameplay and information for us to "get it".

#### Development logs
Each team member will need to create a development log to track individual progress.

This will be the second entry in your development log:
- Date.
- Describe the prototype you want to make, its goals, and its scope.
- Prototyping goals for this week's work session.
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions you asked (refer to the list above for ideas), and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your prototyping.
- A link to documentation below.

#### Documentation
- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated development log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***
