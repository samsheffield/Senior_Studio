# HELLO ! !
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Continue development
- 1-on-1 check-ins

## Work session
You need testable things this week!

## Playtesting (Due Next Week)
You will need to conduct playtesting outside of class over the next 2 weeks.

Here are the expectations:
- Mix of in-person and online playtests (if possible!)
- Use the playtesting channels on the MGL Discord (not his class Discord) to help conduct/organize testing
    - Provide a screenshot, briefly describe your game, how long it will take, and what kind of feedback you're looking for.
- Provide thoughtfully prepared builds
    - Tested and working
    - Test sharing permissions
    - Include build notes (readme.txt) with instructions, controls, known bugs, and how much they are expected to play
    - Include a post-playtesting interview or feedback form 

_Make sure to create documentation of notes taken during each playtest in some sort of shareable format._

## Professional Research (Due Next Week)
Complete professional research related to your practice as a game designer __and send me the link__. Details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/141_9DvZ4S4qN__yfv9oMkTZu_-32KGr9QZbpXLdEgCA/edit?usp=sharing)
