## Playtesting in class today
Have your games in a playable state for us to test!

## Outside Playtesting (Due in the next week)
You will need to conduct more playtesting outside of class over this week.

Here are the expectations:
- Mix of in-person and online playtests (if possible!)
- Use the playtesting channels on the MGL Discord (not his class Discord) to help conduct/organize testing
    - Provide a screenshot, briefly describe your game, how long it will take, and what kind of feedback you're looking for.
- Provide thoughtfully prepared builds
    - Tested and working
    - Test sharing permissions
    - Include build notes (readme.txt) with instructions, controls, known bugs, and how much they are expected to play
    - Include a post-playtesting interview or feedback form 

_Make sure to create documentation of notes taken during each playtest in some sort of shareable format._
