## Today
Begin developing one small (technical) experiment related to one aspect of your chosen game that you're interested in/excited about. We'll go around the room demonstrating these experiments and talkling together about everyone's plans (digital games don't need to be builds) Excited to see what you come up with!


## Due by the end of class
- Share a basic description of your game on the class Discord (2-3 sentence). Also, let me know if you plan to collaborate (this semester or next and with whom).


## Bring to class on the 13th
- One small (technical) experiment related to one aspect of your chosen game that you're interested in/excited about. We'll go around the room demonstrating these experiments and talkling together about everyone's plans. I'm so excited to see what you come up with!
