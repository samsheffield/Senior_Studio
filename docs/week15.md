# Proof of Concept Prototype 1 Final Playtesting

## Today

### Proof-of-concept Prototype final playtesting
Today, we'll meet as a group to run one more playtest on your first prototype.
1. Only provide enough information to run your playtest.
2. Shhh. __Observational only.__ Use a notebook and take notes on what you see.
3. Afterwards we'll follow-up as a group to hear your thoughts and give you any additional feedback we might have.


### End of semester Presentations next week @ 10 AM
