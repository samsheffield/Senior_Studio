# HI
We're back! In person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Discuss the end of the semester
- *Work, work, work, work, work*

## Today

There are two weeks left in this class. __Let's get this work done!__

# Final Prototype Milestone (December 10th, 9:00 AM)

This is a  fully playable beta of your prototype that can be played by people outside of class by GMD faculty and then discussed as a group following the project presentations on the 13th.


__This is a hard deadline. Under no circumstances (aside from a documented emergency) can you miss this deadline.__


# Project Presentations & Review (December 13th)
Each of you will give a brief on your Senior Project to a review panel of MICA faculty. This will focus on your research, inspiration, progress, and plans for the Spring semester (*if applicable*).

We'll discuss the details of the presentation next Monday.


## Deliverable

Digital games:
- An uploaded playable prototype (Tested Win/Mac builds)
- A README.txt file with information on the build (known bugs, non-functioning things, and instructions if not included in-game already)
- Include mapped buttons/keys which quit and restart the game.

Tabletop game: 
- A link to your game on Tabletop Simulator OR print & play/physical edition of the game
- A printable pdf of the rules

## Feedback

You do not need to provide a feedback form for this playtest. Reviewers will give feedback based on their own experiences playing your prototype and your presentation.

# Wednesday...
## Work session
Please make good use of the remaining time we have in class to get your games in to a good place by the deadline
