# HI
We're back! In person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Playtest and discuss your prototypes

## Today

# Prototype Milestone 2 Playtesting
A goal of this prototype is to test your full gameplay loop and see if it connects with us as players, communicating what we are supposed to do, and giving us meaningful feedback on those actions.


## Playtesting

Vanessa, Puhan & Zining:
- Post a link on the class Discord's #milestone-2 channel to your playable Win/Mac builds and playesting feedback form (if not printed)
- Make sure to include README.txt file with information on the build
  - Instructions
  - Controls
  - Known bugs and other non-functioning things

Ariana & Parker: 
- Set up your game on TT Simulator out in the main lab
- Distribute printed copies of rules and information on known issues
- Share playtesting feedback form on class Discord (if not printed)

## Feedback Form
Please provide a playtesting form that can be used to collect specific feedback on your prototype. 
- Google Doc or printed copies
- Focus on a few high quality, specific questions instead of many broad, vague ones (*Is it fun?*)
