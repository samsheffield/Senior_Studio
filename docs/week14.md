## Make sure your game is ready to share
A little checklist for 99% of you!
1. Does the game work on all platforms you are targeting? (PC/Mac/Web/IRL?)
2. Is your downloadable game named something relevant?
3. Did you [replace the default Unity app icon](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsStandalone.html) with something else? (If using Unity)
4. Does your game need release notes? (for things like known bugs, credits, supplementary instructions, or installation help on a Mac)
5. Did you create supporting media (screenshots/gifs and/or a trailer) and a description?


## itch.io page
__Games and their documentation need to be uploaded to itch.io no later than midnight next Thursday (04/27). Send me the link when it's up.__

NOTE: If your game is going to be hosted online elsewhere, please use itch.io as a gateway to it so that we can archive it and help share with our community.

### On your itch.io page:
Focus on these details...
- Describe your game (What do you do? What do you think is novel or interesting about it? )
- Who made it (What role(s) did you play? Where else can you be found online?)
- Builds (downloadable, embedded web build, or link to actual hosted project)
- Cover image which serves as a banner for your page (630 x 500px)
- Media (For example: screenshots, gifs, installation photos, a short video trailer)

### What kind of media?
You get to decide! Can you communicate what's special about your game with just images and words? Is your game complex or difficult to describe without showing it in action?

At minimum, you should have screenshots or photos which are evocative and interesting. _There is no minimum or maximum number._ Create a small set that says something about your game and generates excitement or interest in what you've made, so it's better to have fewer images which look good together and spark curiousity than many redundant/similar images. Also, you do not need to include a screenshot of the title screen. I know it's tempting if you've made a good one. Take advantage of itch.io's cover image to show off any log you've made for your game. 

### But what about video or gifs?
Games which are complex or feature dynamic gameplay benefit _greatly_ from dynamic media (gifs or short videos). Interactive fiction, on the other hand, does not. I'd like you to put energy in areas that seem relevant to the work you've made.

_If you decide to make gifs of a video trailer keep in mind the following things..._

These shouldn't be straightforward walkthroughs of your game. Instead, create dynamic media which highlights the things which you think are  important to what you've made but are difficult to show in still images. Perhaps they create a mood or reflect the tone of your game? Maybe they show off great moments in your game? Maybe they serve as documentation for something site-specific of ephemeral? 

_Not feeling confident in your edting skills?_ Keep it short and simple (no more than 30-60 seconds). Video game trailers tend to follow pretty simliar formulas. Derek Lieu has a great series on producing game trailers. His [5 simple game trailer templates video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvEFwHXm8s&t=202s) is a good place to start.


### Don't overthink it
- Make sure anything you upload actually works (most important)
- Have good media which supports and shows your game in the best light (also incredibly important)
- Use descriptive and compelling language to describe your game (what do you think is exciting or interesting about it?) 
- Itch.io tags and genre labeling can help others find your game (it's surprisingly effective)
- Thinking about designing the itch.io page? Focus on keeping it simple and attractive



# Homework

## Finish polishing your games & begin documenting
__Games and their documentation need to be uploaded to itch.io no later than midnight next Thursday (04/27).__



## Provide me with some promotional materials
Additionally, to help showcase your work,Game Design will be curating our own itch.io collection, sharing celebratory social media posts leading up to and during commencement, and creating a Graduating Class 2023 landing page on the MICA Game Lab website. What we need from you...

- Screenshots or  other visual media for your game (gifs, trailer, recorded gameplay footage)
- Description of your game + who made it (don't forget to include your roles in its development!)
- itch.io link
- Brief bio (tell us about who you are, what you're interests are as game designer/artist, and where to reach you)
- Representative image (a headshot or shareable image of you. This can be straightforward or creative!)
