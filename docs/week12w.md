# Wednesday (11/17)
## Today
Work session in preparation of Milestone 3 (*which is kind of a big one*)

## Milestone 3 Playtest on Monday
__*Ideally...*__

We'll be playing an alpha prototype of your game which is a __functionally complete game or vertical slice__. Must be playable by others without your assistance.

If you're not quite there yet, it's time to take a look at your plans and make some decisions regarding your project's scope.

*This will be the next to last prototyping deadline for this semester.*

## Game Design Docs & Research
If you haven't shared your updated design docs & research with me yet, please email me the link this evening so I can review them.


## Due by the end of class
- __Email me a screenshot (or picture) and a description of the progress you've made on your prototype.__
- __Email me a breakdown of your plans and designated tasks for this week.__

## Next week
- Milestone 3 Review on Monday. Make sure you have work & feedback forms ready *by the start of class*
- __Please arrive to class on time__
