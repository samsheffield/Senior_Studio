# Prototype Check-ins
Class notes for 09/05/23

## Today
### Exploratory Prototype (Due 09/19)
Today, we'll meet as a group to check-in on your progress on the first prototype.
- Show us what are you working on now. (Demonstrate where things currently are. When describing things, be as specific as possible) 
- What are some of your goals for this prototype? (What questions does the prototype to answer for you at this point? And when it's finished?)
- Tell us where you think it's headed


#### Reminders
Just as a reminder, this prototype can be related to an idea you may be interested in pursuing for your thesis project or completely independent of that. 

You can also take successful elements from this work to use in the 2nd exploratory prototype, though it can't be a direct continuation of this one. 

Lastly, you can always revisit this work when forming teams later in the semester, if you like where things are going. 

#### Toys
The goal of prototyping is not to end up with a finished game, it's to test ideas and to learn about what you are making. 

One way you might approach this is to think of what you're making _right now_ as a toy (objects which elicit play) rather than as a game. Focusing on the thing as a small, simple, playful system can help you look for fundamental the verbs and player activities that support a game you make _in the future_.

#### Failure
There's no failure in trying something new. Sometimes prototypes fail and we move on from them to pursue new ones. This is also why we want smaller prototypes with fewer unknowns to focus on. 

Less time + less resources = less investment. It's okay to be ruthless with what you make here.

### Work session
- Work continues!
- I will meet with each of you if there is specific information I would like to follow up on. Grab me if you need to discuss something.
- Read _Catastrophic Prototyping and Other Stories by Chaim Gingold_ (here's [a link](./assets/catastrophic_chaim.md))


#### Schedule
__TODAY: Check-in and sharing__


__09/12: In-progress playtesting__
- Time to test your assumptions
- No questions for players, just observing and note taking
- Feedback (but only if you request it and ask for something specific)

__09/19: Final playtesting and discussion__
- Prototype is completed
- Playtesting session (Feel free to invite people from outside of class)
- No questions for players, just observing and note taking
- Tell us what you were trying to accomplish and how it went
- Feedback and discussion as a group

__09/26: Documentation due__
- One page website highlighting an aspect of the prototype's development and details highlighting your role(s) in its development
- We will discuss strategies for this on 09/19, but for now focus on doing the work and documenting your steps along the way in your weekly development log entries.


## Homework

### Prepare for playtesting next week
__Next week's playtesting is 100% observational.__ Explain only what is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, no talking. 

If you want to follow up afterwards based on something you observed, resist explaining and instead focus on asking questions that relate to the experience your playtesters just had.

Therefore, it's important that you already have some ideas about what assumptions you are putting to test in this playtest. Think about it this week.

__Bring a notepad and writing utensil to class.__ (Don't rely on your phone or laptop.) You will be asked to reflect on the playtest in next week's development log.

### Continue working on Exploratory Prototype 1
You are expected to make some progress on Friday, as well as before or after Friday. 

### Friday's studio work session
We need something playable in the first half of class next week. Digital games can be run as projects on your own computer (no builds necessary). Non-video games require all the things needed to play them to be complete upon arrival. 

Thank you in advance for arriving early if your prototype requires any time-consuming setup.


#### Development log
For your development log:
- Date.
- Prototyping goals for this week's work session.
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions you asked (refer to the list above for ideas), and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your prototyping.
- __Goals for playtesting next week (What do you intend to observe? What questions are you looking to answer with this playtest?)__
- A link to documentation below.

#### Documentation
- Build (or project if you have enough Drive space) for digital games. _For non-video games please submit equivalent proof of work which provides a snapshot of your work._
- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated development log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***


# Upcoming Events

## Next week: Class trip to Code in the Schools 
Next week, we'll meet at [Code in the Schools](https://www.codeintheschools.org/) on North Ave (across from the [Film Center](https://goo.gl/maps/7BkvzBaWoXjpEeoQA)) at 1pm to meet with one of it's Directors to learn about what they do and how you might become involved!

We can walk over as a group or take the MICA shuttle.

## GMD Student Show (09/17-09/25)
I want to show the games from A3D last semester. We can produce whatever kinds of supporting materials you might want to put on the walls. 

Also looking for assistance setting it all up between 09/13-09/16.
