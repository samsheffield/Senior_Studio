# W E L C O M E &nbsp; B A C K ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Where are you?? How have you been? What have you been doing?)
- Discuss this class ([Syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LgEjy1sFZE20Qjrm7LDCe98ZoLp2id3W/view?usp=sharing), Online structure, Spring vs. Fall semesters. Senior Project requirements)
- Concerns, Questions? (This class, Senior year, ...uhh, Everything?!)

Then, we'll take a break and begin meeting individually in breakout rooms (if I can figure that Zoom part out :slightly_smiling_face:) to discuss current ideas for Senior Project, determine who needs to find a teammate, address any concerns privately, catch up briefly. Also...
- These will be no longer than 20 minutes per person.
- I want to prioritize the meeting schedule according to how far you are away from Baltimore. More remote = earlier meeting.
- You don't need to stay active in Zoom until our time to meet, just rejoin the class meeting about 5-10 minutes before your selected time slot. ( :bug: )
- When we're done, you're done! ( :bug: )
[Here is the meeting schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9Ticgjto2_bmNmXr8spZXCqoJ6UFXF6G1iPSzRIiHE/edit?usp=sharing)

( :bug: Unless you need to find a teammate. Then it is your task to chat with your classmates on Zoom, Slack, or elsewhere to see if you can find a possible fit.)

__For Wednesday...__
- You need a teammate and the beginnings of a plan.
- Sign your team up for a meeting time slot on [this shared Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1poffjFeeMnF7h7gIbkbx2t8fVbHphs0LM2MTN9r0ntg/edit?usp=sharing) so we can check-in ( :footprints: ). Do this today or early tomorrow and please prioritize our remotest class members for earlier meeting times.
- I will send out meeting invites by the end of my day tomorrow. Be sure to confirm YES.
- There is no Group meeting this Wednesday. __Our next group meeting will be Wednesday, September 9th @ 9AM EST__.

( :footprints: At least one team member should be able to attend this meeting. This person will speak on behalf of their team and then communicate the discussion with any absent members. They must be enrolled in this class. )
