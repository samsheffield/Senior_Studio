# Prototype 3 Playtesting

## Today

### Prototype 3 Playtesting
Prototype playtesting [completed prototype] & discussion.
- Up to 40 minutes of playtesting and feedback for each prototype
- Have what you need prepared beforehand (we don't have time to wait for builds to be created and uploaded)
- Share a link to any builds via the #playtesting-room channel on the MGL Discord server
- No build? Non-digital game? We can take turns, but we will need to limit the time and not everyone will get hands-on time with your work

Designers:
- Tell us what you were trying to accomplish and how you're feeling about it

Playtesters, feedback should focus on:
- Areas which are successful (interesting, fun, well done)
- Areas for improvement or refinement
- Any questions

### Prototype Post-Development Documentation
An overview of prototype documentation is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1apj_2hbM5vvQdw3SBWpsp4qg2n8GvV_2JhVvrltNwU0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Final Presentation
During the last week of class this semester you will be responsible for presenting preliminary plans for your Senior Project. You will develop this project over the first 12 weeks of the Spring semester. The final weeks of the semester will be used to release your game, develop a presskit, and prepare for the Commencement Exhibition.

The presentations will be open to GMD students and faculty, as well as a professional guest or two. We'll discuss specific requirements at the start of class next week, but here's what you need to do this week in preparation...
 
### Senior Project: Preliminary Document
Prepare a Google Doc with the following details and email it to me before the start of class next week:
- Describe the game you want to make? Be as detailed as possible.
- What is the format (digital, non-digital, hybrid)?
- Which prototype(s) are you using as the basis for this game?
- Why make this game? What excites/interests you about this idea?
- Based on your protoyping, what challenges do you expect to encounter if you make this?
- Can you make _all aspects_ of this game alone? If not, who will you collaborate with?
- What is the smallest possible version of this game you can imagine that still excites you? Describe in as much detail as possible.


## Homework

### Friday's studio work session: Prototype documentation
- Include a link to your in-progress (or finished) post-development documentation instead of a dev log this week.
- ***Remember to send me a link to the updated dev log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***
- ***Yes, I have the link to your folders already. This is to confirm the work is complete and submitted for the day.***

### Complete Preliminary Document
See details above. **Email me before the start of class next week.**
