### This Week: Vian Nguyen Class Visit
Vian Nguyen from Filament Games will be visiting on MGL Discord (#Vian-Nguyen-Visit channel) at 1pm. Have headphones. Don't be late.

A small number of 1-on-1 online meetings to talk with Vian about your work are available; first come, first served. [Here's the sign up sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPPGckye4dfASDYwfHIB0FmpBfeEpCP68XI63fCWXEk/edit?usp=sharing) (Use MICA login).

### Weekly meetings
We'll start each class by doing brief check-ins together with every group. You'll discuss your progress from the prior week, show us some of the work, and lay out plans for this week's development.

### Playtesting
You are required to playtest your game 3 times outside of class during this development period. I'll provide you with some structure for this work.

In addition, you will need to choose dates for 2 in-class playtesting sessions (the 3rd will happen on April 11th). **I need your proposed playtesting dates by the end of class today so we can develop a schedule. You can email me or just tell me directly.**

### Dev Log
**Each week, you are required to email a link to your game development log.** This needs to include:
- Date.
- Goals for this week's work session (based on your game design macro).
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions for yourself, and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your development.
- Documentation of your progress (media such as game builds, digital files of assets, or screengrabs/photos).
