# HELLO ! !
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Professional development day

You will need to conduct more playtesting outside of class over the next 2 weeks.

Here are the expectations:
- Mix of in-person and online playtests (if possible!)
- Use the playtesting channels on the MGL Discord (not his class Discord) to help conduct/organize testing
    - Provide a screenshot, briefly describe your game, how long it will take, and what kind of feedback you're looking for.
- Provide thoughtfully prepared builds
    - Tested and working
    - Test sharing permissions
    - Include build notes (readme.txt) with instructions, controls, known bugs, and how much they are expected to play
    - Include a post-playtesting interview or feedback form 

_Make sure to create documentation of notes taken during each playtest in some sort of shareable format._

## GMD Talk Wednesday @ 2:30: Old Bones, New #BLUD

Join us for a midday talk this Wednesday (March 23rd) for a talk by Greg Lane (Narrative Designer @ Exit 73 Games) and Chris Burns (Animation Director/Animator @ Exit 73 Studios) about the development of their upcoming game, [#BLUD](http://bludgame.com)!

Originally developed as a cartoon pitch, #BLUD is a top-down adventure game about the perils of tangling with the supernatural on a school night. It draws inspiration from the 90's and early 2000's in its UPA revival art style and writing. In this talk, the folks from Exit 73 games will go over what it's like to build off of nostalgia, and how the interests of your youth can lead to the projects of your future.

This talk will take place on Zoom. Link in class Discord and your email!
