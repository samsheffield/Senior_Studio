### Weekly meetings
We'll start each class by doing brief check-ins together with every group. You'll discuss your progress from the prior week, show us some of the work, and lay out plans for this week's development.

### Playtesting
You are required to playtest your game 3 times outside of class during this development period. I'll provide you with some structure for this work.

In addition, you will need to choose dates for 2 in-class playtesting sessions (the 3rd will happen on April 11th). **Email me your proposed playtesting dates by next week so we can develop a schedule.**

- Date.
- Goals for this week's work session (based on your game design macro).
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions for yourself, and any other details that are personally useful.
