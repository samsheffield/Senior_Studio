# Prototype 2 Playtesting

## Today

## Prototype 2 Playtesting
Prototype playtesting [completed prototype] & discussion.
- Up to 20 minutes of playtesting and feedback for each prototype
- Have what you need prepared beforehand (we don't have time to wait for builds to be created and uploaded)
- Share a link to any builds via the #playtesting-room channel on the MGL Discord server
- No build? Non-digital game? We can take turns, but we will need to limit the time and not everyone will get hands-on time with your work

Designers:
- Tell us what you were trying to accomplish and how you're feeling about it

Playtesters, feedback should focus on:
- Areas which are successful (interesting, fun, well done)
- Areas for improvement or refinement
- Any questions

## Prototype Post-Development Documentation
An overview of prototype documentation is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1apj_2hbM5vvQdw3SBWpsp4qg2n8GvV_2JhVvrltNwU0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Homework

### Friday's studio work session: Prototype documentation
- Include a link to your in-progress (or finished) post-development documentation instead of a dev log this week.
- ***Remember to send me a link to the updated dev log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***
- ***Yes, I have the link to your folders already. This is to confirm the work is complete and submitted for the day.***
