## Today
### Discuss the class
So excited to welcome you all back in-person!
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class ([Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kbk7FH3_x0SqIGCmn7EqubIOWVn83O7voqDWuWkBntM/edit?usp=sharing), Course adjustments & reasoning, Spring vs. Fall semesters, expectations and responsibilities)
- Any other concerns or questions? (This class, Senior year, ...uhh, Everything?!)

### Quick 1-on-1 check-ins with everyone
I'd like to meet briefly with each of you to discuss your preliminary plans this semester. Let's schedule 15 minute meetings today after we discuss the syllabus.

## Homework

### Create your working space
- Set up your self-hosted Google Drive folder where you will share work.
- Google Document which will serve as your development log for  classwork
- ***Share a link with me via email.***

### Self Introduction Presentation
Create a 10-15 minute presentation which gives us a sense of where you're coming from, where you are, and where you want to go this at this moment. Give examples. Tell us who you are and what you're interested in.

#### Friday's studio work session

This will be the first entry in your development log:
- Write down and organize your thoughts on the presentation (*where are you? who are you? what do you want to make?*). This will serve as an outline to what you talk about next Tuesday in class.
- Include a link to your in-progress (or finished) presentation in your development log as documentation this week.
- ***Remember to send me a link to the updated dev log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***
