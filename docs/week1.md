# Welcome to Spring '24. Pre-production begins!

## W E L C O M E &nbsp; B A C K ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss the upcoming Spring semester
- Reconnect with projects
- Discuss scheduling

## This semester...
These are our priorities this semester:
- Develop, playtest, and release your Senior Project games
- Continue identifying and researching game design career paths that line up with your skillsets and interests
- Prepare professional materials to support post-MICA plans
- [Here's the Spring '24 syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zERo4_Udrk43SyrUX2A9VRs9Ck42KIv1kYG6JIPoSwI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Senior Project Important Deadlines
- __April 16th: Final in-class playtesting as a group.__ 
- April 23rd: Project documentation (press kit) is due. Itch.io pages are ready to go.
- April 30th: Final presentations for guest panelists

## Pre-production & planning mode
We'll spend the first few weeks of the semester prototyping, planning, and researching. The specific shape of this will depend somewhat on the needs of your project.

At the end of this cycle, you should be able to:
1. Describe what it is you are making
2. Communicate your project goals (design goals + player experience goals).
3. Identify key areas, biggest risks, and unknowns about your project.
3. Use your prototypes as the basis for your game's development.
4. Identify a realistic scope for your work relative to your team size/composition.
5. Sketch out a development schedule.


### Planning & Making
_"A goal without a plan is just a wish"_ - Antoine de Saint-Exupery

No amount of planning that we can do will guarantee that we will make interesting, fun, challenging, meaningful things. We're also faced with the conundrum of trying to plan for things we don't know yet, even as fundamental as _what is this game, anyways??_

Planning can help us understand what we're making, what are its goals, who it is for, and how it's played. It can assist us in making critical decisions regarding the scope and allocation of time/energy/resources towards making it, which is particularly relevant in at this moment where we have limited time/energy/resources. (Deadlines.)

_When is planning done? When can I start making the game?_ Once you know a little about what you want to make, start prototyping. There's no reason to wait for planning to to finished. Truth is, your planning will need to be revised and revisited throughout your game's development.

Designing games is a discovery-based practice, in which we follow our instincts and tastes as designers. There are going to be times when things don't work and we have to move on, or change plans, and times when we have to learn some new thing that we just don't know. _This is normal!_


## Masterpiece Syndrome
Reminder! There is a common issue which pops up around this time for many students regarding their thesis work, in which students put unfair pressure on the role of this work in their lives.

_"It should be perfect, it should be ambitious, it should be better than anything you've ever made, it should demonstrate everything I know and have learned as a student!"_

This kind of thinking can be paralyzing, particularly at the beginning of the semester (_"I don't want to do this wrong"_) and the end (_"This needs to be perfect."_). It can result in anxiety, confusion, and resentment. A lot of people stop making things because they never learn how to manage this.

As a way of countering this kind of non-productive thinking:
1. Focus on making.
2. Don't overthink things.
3. Embrace failures.
4. Keep perspective.


## Scheduling
We need to start thinking about the scheduling of your development to make sure that you are working at a scale that is achievable. This will involve taking stock of what's most important to your game, your working patterns, and how much time we actually have.

*It wil be your responsibility over the next two weeks to develop a realistic picture of the rate at which you can make progress on your project.*

## Constraints
"Art is never finished, only abandoned." - Leonardo DaVinci

Constraints in design are good. They force us to make choices and think beyond our typical ways of doing things. Often constraints are factors beyond our control (time, money, energy), but as designers and artists we are used to setting our own constraints as a way of encouraging creative thinking.

Renowned Mid-Century industrial designers, Charles and Ray Eames, regarded design as dependent largely on [the sum of all constraints](https://disegnojournal.com/newsfeed/the-sum-of-all-constraints).

In our specific case, we have a time constraint that will shape what you make in this class, so we'll benefit from some simple scheduling to get an idea of what additional constraints you may need to implement to get your work done.

## Setting a simple schedule with a prioritized task list

Based on your proof-of-concept prototyping last semester, you already know a lot about your projects. One thing which is probably still unclear is, _will you be able to finish it_? 

We have to start understanding the scope of the game you're proposing to make as you are imagining it now and make any necessary changes so that it is both exciting _and_ achievable. I have great faith that _everyone_ will pull this off this semester.

Let's discuss one approach to scheduling which will help us get an idea of the scope of our proposed projects. [Creating a prioritized task list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmEHAp4GvEmNx0VTWoANKJxc-yphfRN2DBfWA9g6ewQ/edit?usp=sharing).


# Homework

## Set up your shared workspace and share the link
Set up the Google Drive folder you wish to use for development this semester. You are welcome to continue using the one from last semester. Either way, **each team member needs to share the link with me via the Canvas assignment** (Link to your team's online folder). 

Sounds silly, I know, but you would be surprised how many times I've had students locked out of their own projects!

## 2 hours: Timeboxing Exercise: 
Work with your team to...

1. Estimate your total production time using the formula from the document linked above (Time = Weeks x Hours x People)

2. Set up a simple timeboxed schedule for your game's development in the form of a prioritized list. Use a single Google Spreadsheet to do this work.

You will refine this next week with information using the game design macro you develop in class, but this first pass is to give you a general idea as to whether you are thinking too big or have too many unanswered questions about fundamental things.  

**Each team member is responsible for sharing the link to the completed spreadsheet to the Canvas assignment (Prioritized Task List).**



## 4 Hours: Prototyping or Researching

### Need to prototype?
- Identify some aspects of your game which are critical to your game which still need investigation and make small prototypes which tests their viability. 

### Need to research?
- Identify some aspect of your game which you want to know more about and conduct some research on it.
- Be sure to document your research and what you learned.

_You do not need to submit these anywhere. We will check-in next week and you can discuss your work then._


# Coming soon

## Global Game Jam!
Global Game Jam is coming up soon (Jan 26-28th). This is a great opportunity to warm up, finish a small game for your portfolio, work with new people/work with old friends/work by yourself, and have fun! 

Also, just as a reminder, the GGJ consistently pops up in conversations with visiting developers as something they view _very positively_ from prospective employees. It demonstrates your engagement with game development outside of school assignments, your ability to meet deadlines and work within constraints, and (possibly) your ability to work with others.
