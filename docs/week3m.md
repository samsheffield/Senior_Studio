# HI HI ! !
We're back! In person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Provide updates on visitor scheduling
- Check in regarding Senior Project plans
- Share this past week's experiments
- Begin discussing the role of research in this class
- __Our next group meeting will be Monday, September 20th @ 9AM EST (IN-PERSON)__. 

## Today
__Visitors!__

We have some visitors scheduled for this semester. There might be some additions (waiting for confirmation). 

__Attend these visits. Most are *specifically* for you__. Links will be provided for talks once available, since most will be online.

- __Sept 20th (M) @ 10:00 AM__ - Heather Slania (Head of the [Decker Library](https://www.mica.edu/libraries/decker-library/), GMD liason, and __game lover__) will do a class visit to discuss using the library as a tool for research this semester and next.
- __Oct 6th (W) @ 4:00 PM__ - Lucas Wooleyhand (Product Manager, [Big Huge Games](http://bighugegames.com)) will be talking with you (and other interested GMD students) about various game design roles within in a commercial game studio, plus his own work experiences in *The Industry* (both good & not-so-good
- __Nov 10th (W) @ 4:30 PM__ - [Winnie Song](https://wsong.me) (Game Designer of BAD BLOOD, Former Square Enix Montreal, Current NYU Game Center faculty) will be giving a talk about her work.

__Share plans and experiments__

We are going to go around the room and share...
- Each team's initial plans (we ahve 3 different games this semester)
- The related experiment you made this week (show digital work using the projector, and non-digital work from one of the desks at the back of the room)

__Senior Project research__

Research is going to play a big role in the development of your prototypes this year. You'll start this week by producing a preliminary design document, and continue conducting and documenting your research as the semester  continues (typically in line with when milestones are set on the schedule)

Research is not just a thing done at the beginning, or end, of development. While it is incredibly beneficial to do a lot of research before starting to really dig into your work, it's actually an ongoing process which helps us understand our work and make informed choices throughout its development.

- Reminder: This work session is not optional. You will have work due by the end of the day.

# Homework
__Planning Document (Due next week)__

Each team will upload a planning document which includes precedents for mechanics, thematic elements, & visual inspiration. This document will also provide a detailed proposal for weekly goals that are planned around the prototype milestones. Please remember, this is the start, not end, of the research you will do for your Senior Project.

*Share a link to your Google Doc with me via email.*

...

__Proof-of-Concept (Due September 27th)__

Create a small exploration of what your game fundamentally is about. The focus should be on your core mechanics, systems, and ideas; and able to demonstrate what excites you about your game. Absolutely no focus on audiovisual assets. Use thoughtful placeholders for art.

Deliverable:
Uploaded prototype materials (Digital game: Build, Non-digital game: print & play or equivalent) that you demonstrate for the class (live, or prerecorded).
