# Development: Work Session
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review game design macros
- Development

## Share game design macros & protoyping/research (or link to GGJ game) from this past weekend
- **Please email me a link to these if you have not already**.

## Game Development (02/07 - 04/11)
The development of your game will take place over the next two months. You will have an opportunity to work during class most weeks, so make sure that you have what you need with you.

Now is the time to **use your prioritized task list and macro to develop a sequential list of tasks for your development.** All of this planning work is only useful if you actually adhere to it. Do your best. Don't forget to make adjustments as you need it (and that those adjustments affect other areas of your development)

### Weekly meetings
We'll start each class by doing brief check-ins together with every group. You'll discuss your progress from the prior week, show us some of the work, and lay out plans for this week's development.

### Playtesting
You are required to playtest your game 3 times outside of class during this development period. I'll provide you with some structure for this work.

In addition, you will need to choose dates for 2 in-class playtesting sessions (the 3rd will happen on April 11th). **Email me your proposed playtesting dates sometime over the next two weeks so we can develop a schedule.**

### Dev Log
**Each week, you are required to email a link to your game development log.** This needs to include:
- Date.
- Goals for this week's work session (based on your game design macro).
- Description of what you actually accomplished, problems encountered, questions for yourself, and any other details that are personally useful.
- Next steps for your development.
- Documentation of your progress (media such as game builds, digital files of assets, or screengrabs/photos).

## Upcoming Class Visits
We have some 
- 02/21: Vian Nguyen from Filament Games (1-on-1 Zoom meetings will also be available)
- 03/21: Justin Sirois from Severed Books (in-person class visit)
- TBD: Andrea Dixon from Exhibitions (Discuss Commencement Show and Artwalk)
