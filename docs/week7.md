## Today
### Exploratory Prototype playtesting
Today, we'll meet as a group to playtest your first prototype.
1. Only provide enough information to run your playtest.
2. Shhh. __Observational only.__ Use a notebook and take notes on what you see.
3. You are allowed to ask questions afterwards, but only if they are based on things you observed.


## Homework

### Fall Break

Fall Break starts Friday evening. Please take a break.

### Prepare for final playtesting after the break
__Next week's playtesting is also 100% observational.__ Explain only what is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, no talking until we have some follow-up as a group.

If you want to follow up afterwards based on something you observed, resist explaining and instead focus on asking questions that relate to the experience your playtesters just had.

Therefore, it's important that you already have some ideas about what assumptions you are putting to test in this last playtest. Think about what your overall goals are for the prototype this week. Are you close?

__Bring a notepad and writing utensil to class.__ (Don't rely on your phone or laptop.) You will be asked to reflect on the playtest in next week's development log.

### Complete development on Exploratory Prototype 2
You are expected to make some progress on Friday, as well as after Fall Break.

### Friday's studio work session
We need something fully playable (relative to your own goals) in class next week. Digital games can be run as projects on your own computer (no builds necessary). Non-video games require all the things needed to play them to be complete upon arrival. 

Thank you in advance for arriving early if your prototype requires any time-consuming setup.

### Documentation
- Build (or project if you have enough Drive space) for digital games
- 3 examples of other detailed documentation like writing, sketches, screenshots, photos which serve as a snapshot of your progress.

***Remember to send me a link to the updated development log by 5pm on Friday to confirm work.***
