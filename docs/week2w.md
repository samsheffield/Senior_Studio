## Today
Begin developing one small (technical) experiment related to one aspect of your chosen game that you're interested in/excited about.


## Due by the end of class
- Share a basic description of your game on the class Discord (2-3 sentence). Also, let me know if you plan to collaborate (this semester or next and with whom).
- __Email me a screenshot (or picture) and a description of the progress you've made on your experiment by the end of the night.__

## Bring to class on the 13th
- Your small experiment. We'll go around the room demonstrating these experiments and talkling together about everyone's plans. I'm so excited to see what you come up with!
