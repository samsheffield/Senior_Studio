# GOOD MORNING ! !
We're back... In person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review your project professional development goals for the semester
- Reconnect with projects and work!

## Work session
While you work, I'm going to take a look at your goal setting notes and then...

## Quick check-ins with everyone
I'd like to meet briefly with each group to discuss your preliminary plans this semester. You'll refine this for homework over the weekend.

Let's meet here in Zoom in this order:
- Parker
- Vanessa
- Zining & Puhan


# Homework

## Global Game Jam (Friday-Sunday)
It's that time again! Maybe warm up for the semester with a little project this weekend? With [this super secret (not-so-secret) theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6on52GnVE0w)?

- Register [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2022/jam-sites/mica-game-lab)
- I'm also in need of help checking in on jammers that anyone can provide over the weekend. Basically, be available to stop in at scheduled times to provide feedback, encouragement, distratction to those in need! __Let me know if you're interested__.

## Otherwise...
Work on your project. We're going to check in as a group on progress in two weeks.
