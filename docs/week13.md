# Prototype 3 Work Session

## Today

### Work Session & Prototype 3 Check-ins
Get some work done today! After lunch, we'll check in with everyone and take a look at your progress so far. We may have class visitors from a school in Hamburg, Germany who are in seeing what you are up to. Please have something to show!

#### Need some playtesting?
We can do some playtesting will be managed by request. Let us know after lunch if you want to test. 

## Homework

### Thanksgiving break
Take a little time off this week! No dev log or documentation due before next class.

### Prototype 3 is due after break
Make sure you are budgeting your time today and this weekend and reach out for help if you get stuck.

_No late prototypes this cycle._ You'll need some time to make some plans for next semester and prepare a presentation.
