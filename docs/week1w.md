# Wednesday (09/01)

## Today
Your goal for today: Come up with 3 potential ideas for small games that you might like to make as your Senior Project. 

Create a Google Doc to explore your ideas and include the following for each one:
- What is the general idea for the game?
- What is the format (digital, non-digital, hybrid)?
- What is one pre-existing game similar to your idea? Provide a link and a description of how you think they are related.
- Can you make this game alone? If not, who might you reach out to for support, or to collaborate with? Either this semester or next.
- Give at least one example of a game that you've worked on which demonstrates some relevant game design experience. Please describe your role(s) if it was developed in a team (provide link)
- What excites/interests you about this idea?
- What challenges do you expect to encounter if you make this?
- What is the smallest possible version of this game you can imagine?

## Due by the end of class
- Share a link to a Google Doc in the class Discord #week-1 channel by the end of the day on Wednesday.

## Due by the end of class on the 6th
- Choose one of your ideas to proceed with this semester and write a short description (2-3 sentences, maximum) of the game's basic premise on the #week-2 Discord channel (will be created next week). If you have made plans to collaborate with others, please indicate it here as well.

## Bring to class on the 13th
- One small (technical) experiment related to one aspect of your chosen game that you're interested in/excited about. We'll go around the room demonstrating these experiments and talkling together about everyone's plans. I'm so excited to see what you come up with!
