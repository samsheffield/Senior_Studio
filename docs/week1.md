# Welcome to Spring '24. Pre-production begins!

## W E L C O M E &nbsp; B A C K ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss the upcoming Spring semester
- Reconnect with projects
- Discuss scheduling

## This semester...
These are our priorities this semester:
- Develop, playtest, and release your Senior Project games
- Continue identifying and researching game design career paths that line up with your skillsets and interests
- Prepare professional materials to support post-MICA plans
- [Here's the Spring '24 syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zERo4_Udrk43SyrUX2A9VRs9Ck42KIv1kYG6JIPoSwI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Senior Project Important Deadlines
- __April 16th: Final builds produced and Google Drive link shared via MGL Discord.__ Final in-class playtest as a group
- April 23rd: Project documentation (press kit) is due. Itch.io pages are ready to go.
- April 30th: Final presentations for guest panelists

## Pre-production & planning mode
We'll spend the first few weeks of the semester prototyping, planning, and researching. The specific shape of this will depend somewhat on the needs of your project.

At the end of this cycle, you should be able to:
1. Describe what it is you are making
2. Communicate your project goals (design goals + player experience goals).
3. Identify key areas, biggest risks, and unknowns about your project.
3. Use your prototypes as the basis for your game's development.
4. Identify a realistic scope for your work relative to your team size/composition.
5. Sketch out a development schedule.


### Planning & Making
_"A goal without a plan is just a wish"_ - Antoine de Saint-Exupery

No amount of planning that we can do will guarantee that we will make interesting, fun, challenging, meaningful things. We're also faced with the conundrum of trying to plan for things we don't know yet, even as fundamental as _what is this game, anyways??_

Planning can help us understand what we're making, what are its goals, who it is for, and how it's played. It can assist us in making critical decisions regarding the scope and allocation of time/energy/resources towards making it, which is particularly relevant in at this moment where we have limited time/energy/resources. (Deadlines.)

_When is planning done? When can I start making the game?_ Once you know a little about what you want to make, start prototyping. There's no reason to wait for planning to to finished. Truth is, your planning will need to be revised and revisited throughout your game's development.

Designing games is a discovery-based practice, in which we follow our instincts and tastes as designers. There are going to be times when things don't work and we have to move on, or change plans, and times when we have to learn some new thing that we just don't know. _This is normal!_


## Masterpiece Syndrome
Reminder! There is a common issue which pops up around this time for many students regarding their thesis work, in which students put unfair pressure on the role of this work in their lives.

_"It should be perfect, it should be ambitious, it should be better than anything you've ever made, it should demonstrate everything I know and have learned as a student!"_

This kind of thinking can be paralyzing, particularly at the beginning of the semester (_"I don't want to do this wrong"_) and the end (_"This needs to be perfect."_). It can result in anxiety, confusion, and resentment. A lot of people stop making things because they never learn how to manage this.

As a way of countering this kind of non-productive thinking:
1. Focus on making.
2. Don't overthink things.
3. Embrace failures.
4. Keep perspective.


## Scheduling
We need to start thinking about the scheduling of your development to make sure that you are working at a scale that is achievable. This will involve taking stock of what's most important to your game, your working patterns, and how much time we actually have.

*It wil be your responsibility over the next two weeks to develop a realistic picture of the rate at which you can make progress on your project.*

## Constraints
"Art is never finished, only abandoned." - Leonardo DaVinci

Constraints in design are good. They force us to make choices and think beyond our typical ways of doing things. Often constraints are factors beyond our control (time, money, energy), but as designers and artists we are used to setting our own constraints as a way of encouraging creative thinking.

In our specific case, we have a time constraint that will shape what you make in this class, so we'll benefit from some simple scheduling to get an idea of what additional constraints you may need to implement to get your work done.

## Setting a simple schedule
We'll begin setting a simple schedule by estimating our project's scope...

### How much time is available?
We can do some simple math to estimate your total available production time:

- Determine how many weeks you have for development. (We have 8 for this project)
- Determine how many hours you have each week on average to work on your project. (6 hours. Minimum of 5 outside of class + minimum of 1 hour a week in-class)
- Determine how many people are on your team (Most people in this class will be 1 person teams)

Then use the formula: Production time (48 or 96 hours) = number of weeks (8) x number of hours (6) x number of people on team (1 or 2).

*Does this seem like enough time? How do you know?*

### Estimating scope
Scope refers to the list of achievable things in a project. 

There are different strategies you can use in your planning, such as developing a game design macro spreadsheet, that can generate a detailed list of the critical things in your game. Having this degree of granularity is very informative, because it provides a clear picture of the tasks required to make your game. However, even without this much detail, we can begin estimating production time based on what we already know about our goals, skills, and priorities from the protoyping that you've already done.

### Check your scope with a prioritized task list
Now comes the part where you determine if this project is viable at the scale your imagining it. This is the simple scheduling part.

For this work, it's helpful if you make a simple 4 column spreadsheet to help keep it organized. [Here's a template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MY6pPJ2BMkKRPS5r-q1D0qjPDfCnrxaidAy7j_E1vl0/edit?usp=sharing) you can copy 
that identifies tasks, their priority, the hours estimated to accomplish the task, and the team member assigned.


#### 1. Identify tasks
Be thorough and try to list as many tasks as you can think of necessary to your game's development. The game design macro approach (which we'll look at next week) can give you a detailed framework for this kind of work.

#### 2. Estimate time to complete each task
Keep it simple. Too small of an increment will make this list unwieldy. Too big an increment lacks important detail. Use 1, 2, 4, or 8 hour blocks to avoid getting too bogged down in details. Expect everything to take much longer than anticipated

*In our case, use the prototyping work you did last semester as a guide to how long things take you to do (if you were deliberate and detailed in your documentation last semester, here's one way it pays off).*

#### 3. Set priorities
Set a priority for your tasks. This is harder than it appears because... isn't everything  obviously a 1?? Don't overthink it:
- Priority 1: These are mandatory things that can't be cut. For example, fundamental functional stuff and fundamental visual and audio stuff.
- Priority 2: These are things your game needs but that you might cut. Secondary things related to interactons, visuals, sounds, and mechanics.
- Priority 3: These are the nice to have things. This might include a more diverse range of objects or visuals, or bonus levels that aren't central to what you are making.

#### 4. Assign tasks without overlap
Delegate tasks to team members. *One task to one team member*. Collaboration doesn't mean that we are working on the same exact thing at the same time.

### Add it all up!
Does the number of hours in the task list fit within your production time? If not, you either need more people or to reduce the scope of the game you are making. Be realistic about your time and your goals. 


## Timeboxing
The approach to simple scheduling above is a form of timeboxing. [Timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) is project management concept commonly associated with Agile Software Development practices which are regularly found in commercial game development (iterative, incremental, and quality focused). 

It's a simple form of scheduling in which you assign critical tasks a fixed amount of time. If you start to run short on time, you have to reduce the scope of the task. This will be the expectation in this class as well. If you wing it, you have no way of guaranteeing that you'll mee the level of quality that you want to achieve with your game.

### What if you run out of time and its not done or good enough?
Running out of time is a *huge problem* in commercial game development. It is far better to realize you're in over your head early on in a project by doing a small amount of planning than realizing it by running out of time at the end of development. A small amount of planning can can help you focus on project goals and priorities.

If you do start to run out of time on your scheduled timeboxing task, think about what youre trying to achieve, how long you think it will take, and whether your plans need to change to focus on fewer (or possibly different) things. 

Remember, not everything you onced imagined in your game will definitely be there. Prioritize the good stuff.


## Timeboxing exercise: 
1. Estimate your total production time using the formula above (T = W x H X P)

2. Use the approach described above to set up a simple timeboxed schedule for your game's development in the form of a prioritized list. 

You will refine this next week with information using the game design macro you develop in class, but this first pass is to give you a general idea as to whether you are thinking too big or have too many unanswered questions about fundamental things.  

## 1-on-1 meetings with each team
Let's meet to reconnect with your goals and preliminary plans heading into this semester. We'll set up a schedule during class.


# Homework



# Coming soon

## Global Game Jam!
Global Game Jam is coming up soon (Jan 26-28th). This is a great opportunity to warm up, finish a small game for your portfolio, work with new people/work with old friends/work by yourself, and have fun! 

Also, just as a reminder, the GGJ consistently pops up in conversations with visiting developers as something they view _very positively_ from perspective employees. It demonstrates your engagement with game development outside of school assignments, your ability to meet deadlines and work within constraints, and (possibly) your ability to work with others.
