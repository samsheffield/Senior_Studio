# HELLO AGAIN
We're back! In person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Progress check-ins as a group
- Work session
- __Next Monday is Fall Break, so our next group meeting will actually be Wednesday, October 20th @ 5PM EST (IN-PERSON)__

## Today

# Prototype Milestone 1 (October 25th)
The goal for this next month is to see how the pieces fit together in a broader sense than with your proof of concept. Is it achieving your player experience goals? Is it fun/interesting/compelling? How can we help make it better?

__We will be discussing your progress as a group each week. You're responsible weekly planning and goal setting, which we will review each week together. Playtesting is welcome every week as well.__

Here are the *minimum* expectations for 10/25...
- A prototype which is a small playable section of your game. This does not need to be your entire game/vertical slice (but it might be!)
- Early, or in-progress, audiovisual assets. 
- The game can certainly be in a buggy, but it needs to be playable so you will need to direct us around issues, problems, incomplete, non-functional stuff.

## Deliverable

Digital game:
- An uploaded playable prototype (Tested Win/Mac builds) 
- A README.txt file with information on the build (known bugs, non-functioning things, and instructions if not included in-game already)
- Include mapped buttons/keys which quit and restart the game.

Non-digital game: 
- Print & play or paper prototype equivalent
- Have 3 full sets available for in-class testing
- Printed copy of the rules and information on known issues

## Feedback

These prototypes will be played in class and discussed as a group. Please provide a playtesting form that can be used to collect specific feedback on your prototype. 


__Work Session. Group check-ins__

The remainder of today will be a work session. You are welcome to work wherever you would like, but make sure to let me know if we'll be meeting in-person or on our Discord.

Work on developing your prototype. Let's have something that can be demonstrated next week.
