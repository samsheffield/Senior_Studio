# Wednesday (10/20)

## Today
- Today is a work session. Make sure that you are meeting your production goals for Milestone 1
- Group check-ins. Please reach out after class if you need anything


# Prototype Milestone 1 (MONDAY)
The goal for this next month is to see how the pieces fit together in a broader sense than with your proof of concept. Is it achieving your player experience goals? Is it fun/interesting/compelling? How can we help make it better?

__We will be discussing your progress as a group each week. You're responsible weekly planning and goal setting, which we will review each week together. Playtesting is welcome every week as well.__

Here are the *minimum* expectations for 10/25...
- A prototype which is a small playable section of your game. This does not need to be your entire game/vertical slice (but it might be!)
- Early, or in-progress, audiovisual assets. 
- The game can certainly be in a buggy, but it needs to be playable so you will need to direct us around issues, problems, incomplete, non-functional stuff.

## Deliverable

Digital games:
- An uploaded playable prototype (Tested Win/Mac builds)
- A README.txt file with information on the build (known bugs, non-functioning things, and instructions if not included in-game already)
- Include mapped buttons/keys which quit and restart the game.

Tabletop game: 
- Set up on Tabletop Simulator and ready to play on the main lab "lounge" PC
- 4 printed copies of the rules and information on known issues

## Feedback

These prototypes will be played in class and discussed as a group. Please provide a brief bplaytesting form (printed or via a Google Drive link) that can be used to collect *specific feedback* on your prototype. I'd recommend focusing on a few high quality, big impact questions rather than a bunch of mushy "is it fun?" questions.


## Due by the end of class
- No need to update me on progress, we'll see your work on Monday :)

## Next week
- Milestone 1 Review on Monday. Make sure you have your work ready to play *by the start of class*.
