# End of Semester!

## Uploading your games for review (New deadline: Saturday morning!)
- The link to the Google Drive folder which our reviewers will use to access your work was shared with you earlier this morning.
- There is a document in the main folder with an overview of what's expected for each game.
- Please have everything uploaded by __9 a.m. on Saturday morning__ and share the link on our class Discord to confirm.

## Reviews & presentations next Tuesday @ 10 a.m.
- These will take place online (but please be here in-person)
- I will send everyone a Zoom link later this week


# Presentation Content

Each team is responsible for creating a short presentation on their game no longer than 15 minutes in length. Use Powerpoint, Keynote, or Google Slides to organize your talk.

## Each presentation should include...
- Title of your game
- Names of team members & their roles.
- A 2-3 sentence description which succinctly and excitedly describes your game.
    - What kind of game is it? (Genre(s), play style)
    - What is your game's theme & setting?
    - What is your game's hook? (What's one novel, fun, or interesting thing about it)
- Inspiration
    - 4-5 significant precedents for your game. This can be a mix of games and non-games media (animation, film, books, stories, music, etc.)
    - Give examples of what you learned from these or how you used them as precedents for your own work.
- Development Process Overview
    - Tell us about the development of your project. Where did it come from? How did it get to where it is? Show us pictures.
- What are the plans for your game's future development?

## Important

Presentations will start at 10 a.m.
- Do not be late.

## Want to practice?

Presentations will be a maximum of 15 minutes long. _Practice beforehand._ Do not improvise or wing it.

I'm happy to meet online over the weekend or Monday evening if you want to practice your presentation. Email me a request beforehand and we'll schedule it.

# Portfolio Development Tips for Game Designers
Art school can lead you to believe that it's all about portfolio, portfolio, portfolio. While it's important when searching for opportunities to have materials available, you don't need to overthink this:

## Keep it simple

One of the most daunting things about collecting your work online is sometimes the feeling that you need a super unique website. You don't. For most people, simple and straightforward is going to work best. 

## You portfolio should tell people...
1. Who you are.
2. What you do.
3. How people can connect with you.

## Three things that do not matter...
1. Where you host your site (It's okay to use a sitebuilder like [squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), [wix](https://www.wix.com), [adobe portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com), [wordpress](https://wordpress.com))
2. The URL (people will find you through search engines, social networks, itch.io, linkedin, etc.). 
3. Unique/clever web design (again, use a sitebuilder if you don't already have web design skills)

## Should you pay money for this?

- Paid hosting & dedicated URL signal a degree of professionalism, but they are not mandatory. 
- Paid webhosting specifically can sometimes remove branding/advertising which you might find confusing or don't want to be connected with.

## No one is looking for your website (most of the time!)
- People are looking for you when they find you elsewhere and want more information
- Social media and participation in other networks/communities is valuable (but you get to pick your communities and your engagement level!)
- Have things ready and don't wait for an opportunity to arrive to begin preparing materials

## Let's look at some portfolios by recent grads

## Media for Senior Studio game packaging (Complete by end of the semester)
We will pay to fabricate USB promo boxes for your completed Senior Studio game. [Here is the link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T84oBKlAGsAJs3zXgnF0BomGon-8hPxs?usp=sharing) to a template provided by Red Paper Plane.

- You can approach this in whatever way makes sense for your game
- Use images that are large or high DPI (300dpi if possible)
- Include screengrabs and a brief, compelling description of your game for the back cover.

Have a non-digital game? We can also discuss purchasing components, boxes, or other forms of fabrication!

_You can pick these up in-person over the summer or we can mail them to you!_

## Work due this Saturday!
Stay healthy! Have a plan! Reach out for help!
