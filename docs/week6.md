# HELLO ! !
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Continue development
- 1-on-1 check-ins

## Work session
Get some work done, because you have some playtesting to organize very soon!

## Playtesting (Due 03/08)
You will need to conduct playtesting outside of class over the next 2 weeks.

Here are the expectations:
- Mix of in-person and online playtests (if possible!)
- Use the playtesting channels on the MGL Discord (not his class Discord) to help conduct/organize testing
    - Provide a screenshot, briefly describe your game, how long it will take, and what kind of feedback you're looking for.
- Provide thoughtfully prepared builds
    - Tested and working
    - Test sharing permissions
    - Include build notes (readme.txt) with instructions, controls, known bugs, and how much they are expected to play
    - Include a post-playtesting interview or feedback form 

_You will be asked to produce documentation of notes taken during each playtest, so make sure that they are in a shareable format._

## Professional Research (Due 03/08)
For homework over the next two weeks, I would also like you to begin doing a little professional research related to your practice as a game designer. See description for details ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/141_9DvZ4S4qN__yfv9oMkTZu_-32KGr9QZbpXLdEgCA/edit?usp=sharing))


## WEDNESDAY: Bo Ruberg talk on Wednesday (02/23) @ 2:30!!

__Video Games to Play after the End of the World: Queer Visions of the Post-Apocalypse__

In this talk, Prof. Bo Ruberg will discuss the rich intersections between queerness and video games. After offering an introduction to queer game studies and queer indie make making, they will dive into the topic of apocalypses and post-apocalypses in video games. Apocalyptic themes are pervasive across game genres. Now, under the shadow of climate collapse and the current pandemic, a growing number of independent queer and trans game designers are using scenes of the end of the world to explore alternate forms of identity, community, and society. Here, Ruberg explains how apocalypses and post-apocalypses take on queer meaning in video games, and how they show us the possibility for creating a new, queerer world after the one that we know today has ended.

And here's a bio:

Dr. Bo Ruberg (they/them) is an associate professor in the Department of Film and Media Studies and an affiliate faculty member in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, as well as the incoming co-editor of the Journal of Cinema and Media Studies. Their research explores gender and sexuality in digital media and digital cultures. They are the author of three monographs: Video Games Have Always Been Queer (NYU Press, 2019), The Queer Games Avant-Garde: How LGBTQ Game Makers Are Reimagining the Medium of Video Games (2020), and Sex Dolls at Sea: Imagined Histories of Sexual Technologies (MIT Press, 2022). They are also the co-editor of Queer Game Studies (University of Minnesota Press, 2017) and Live Streaming Culture (MIT Press, forthcoming).
