# W E L C O M E &nbsp; B A C K ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. In person! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello! (Who are you? How have you been? What are you excited/nervous about this semester?)
- Discuss this class ([Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BI7XjI9RXKMh7cufjvSLwLwSzmLhcsSY4yqiUn23JiU/edit?usp=sharing), Hybrid structure, Spring vs. Fall semesters, Expectations and responsibilities)
- Discuss Senior Project ([overview here]())
- Any other concerns or questions? (This class, Senior year, ...uhh, Everything?!)

## Quick check-ins with everyone
I'd like to meet briefly with each group to discuss your preliminary goals this semester. You'll refine this for homework this weekend.

__Homework__
- Join the class Discord server ([link]()). Set your server nickname to what you want to be called in class and then say hello.
