## Senior Studio (GMD 498.01)

### About
This is the class site for Game Design Senior Studio, taught in the Game Design program at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Fall 2021.

### Course Description
Students will spend the semester developing a small game prototype that they will then refine and polish during the Spring semester. The goal of this course is for students to demonstrate their ability to research, design, and test a game which conveys their own personal voice as well as an understanding of the field of game design. 

#### This Semester...
The focus will be on prototyping a small complete game or vertical slice of a larger game. At the end of this semester you will present your research, your current progress, and plans for your gameâ€™s future development in the spring.

#### Next Semester...
The focus will be on refining and promoting your playable prototype into a complete
demo and professional development. For digital games, a playable demo with social media
promotion and full presskit will be the final deliverables. For non-digital games, a fabricated
deliverable with social media promotion and full presskit, plus print & play (or other
appropriate format) will be due at the end of the semester.

### Course Goals
- Learn to research, design, and build refined games and other playful projects
- Gain experience conducting research, developing project plans, and managing a multi-month game development project.
- Critically communicate & present game designs from concept to finished form.

### Student Learning Outcomes
- Students will demonstrate an understanding of how to build, test, and evaluate games using player-centric, iterative design methodologies.
- Students will be able to analyze and critically discuss games as complex interactive systems.
- Students will gain skills in communicating and presenting ideas from concept to finished form.

### Software Versions
Software used to create any demos will be listed here.
